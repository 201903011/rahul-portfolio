### Overview


      
#### 1) Need for developing the website

When it comes to hosting or participating a campaign, spreading awareness about it becomes very crucial. It can be done by various physical methods or through an online platform. Campaign creator provides convenience in creating
different campaigns and eases the process of participating in a campaign.
 
#### 2) Problem Definition Aim and Objective

In this progressing era of digitalization where there is a need of a reliable and well-functioning source through which it is possible to create and host and participate in a campaign to help the society. Since it becomes difficult to manually keep a track of all upcoming campaigns and all the possible registrations for it, we have planned this project. This may encourage individuals to participate more and more into such social campaigns. 

#### 3)	Scope of the project

The current aim of this project is to enhance the feasibility for the user and providing a secure environment for campaign creation and participation. For this it is necessary to know the user demands and compare it with the scalability of our project which would lead to an interactive and dynamic website.
