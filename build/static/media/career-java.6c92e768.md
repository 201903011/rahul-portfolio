I made a java maven application which have login and registration part. I provide email verification via otp achieved by java activation email library.  After Login I provide a test which can predict the steam and interest of user.  And there is result part and there is guidance text for  all streams. I use SQL and RDBMS for making database and reducing data redudancy and use triggers for creating result.
